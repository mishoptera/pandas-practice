--You've started a new movie-rating website, and you've been collecting data on reviewers' ratings of various movies. There's not much data yet, but you can still try out some interesting queries. Here's the schema:

--Movie ( mID, title, year, director ) English: There is a movie with ID number mID, a title, a release year, and a director.

--Reviewer ( rID, name ) English: The reviewer with ID number rID has a certain name.

--Rating ( rID, mID, stars, ratingDate )  English: The reviewer rID gave the movie mID a number of stars rating (1-5) on a certain ratingDate.

-- Your queries will run over a small data set conforming to the schema. View the database. (You can also download the schema and data.)

-- Q1: Find the titles of all movies directed by Steven Spielberg.
SELECT title
    FROM Movie
    WHERE director LIKE 'Steven Spielberg';

-- Q2: Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order.
SELECT DISTINCT mv.year
    FROM Movie as mv
        LEFT JOIN Rating as ra
            ON mv.mID = ra.mID
    WHERE ra.stars >= 4
ORDER BY mv.year;
